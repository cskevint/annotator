## Features

- **Multi-Image Upload**: Upload and manage multiple images simultaneously with drag-and-drop support
- **PDF Support**: Upload PDF files that are automatically converted to high-resolution images (300 DPI) per page
- **Interactive Annotation**: Click and drag to create circular annotations with thick, high-visibility styling (8-10px lines)
- **Simplified Annotation Management**: Two primary modes - Draw and enhanced Select with integrated move, resize, and delete
- **Enhanced Select Mode**: Click to select, drag to move, resize via handles, and delete with X button (controls scale with zoom for visibility)
- **Smart Workflow**: Automatically switches to Select mode after drawing and selects newly created annotations
- **Auto-Selection**: First uploaded image is automatically selected when no images are loaded
- **Focus Zoom**: Intelligent zoom to optimal viewing level for selected annotations
- **Center-Fixed Zoom Controls**: Zoom in/out while maintaining canvas center point, fit-to-screen, actual size, and focus-annotation
- **Zoom-Responsive UI**: Delete and resize buttons automatically scale for optimal visibility at all zoom levels
- **Smart Auto-Fit**: Images automatically fit to screen when selected for optimal viewing
- **Spacebar Panning**: Hold spacebar + drag for temporary panning in any mode (like Photoshop)
- **Maximum Canvas Utilization**: Canvas automatically uses all available width and height for optimal workspace

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Cmd/Ctrl + Plus**: Zoom in (1.5x steps) while keeping canvas center fixed

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cskevint/annotator.git
cd annotator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload Images**: Drag and drop images or PDF files, or use the file picker to upload web-compatible images (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP) and PDF documents

2. **Auto-Selection**: The first uploaded image is automatically selected when no images are loaded, ready for immediate annotation

3. **Create Annotations**: 
   - Select "Draw" mode in the toolbar
   - Click and drag on the image to create circular annotations
   - The radius expands as you move away from the initial click point
   - **Automatically switches to Select mode** with the new annotation selected for immediate editing

4. **Manage Annotations**:
   - **Select Mode**: Click any annotation to select it, then:
     - **Delete**: Click the red X button in the top-right corner of the selected annotation
     - **Move**: Click and drag anywhere inside the selected annotation to move it
     - **Resize**: Click and drag the red resize handle (circle on the right edge) to adjust size
   - **Label**: Add descriptive labels to annotations using the label input that appears when an annotation is selected

5. **Navigate & Zoom**:
   - **Auto-Fit**: Images automatically fit to screen when first selected for optimal viewing
   - **Zoom In/Out**: Use zoom controls to get closer or farther from the image
   - **Fit to Screen**: Automatically fit the entire image in the viewport
   - **Actual Size**: View image at 100% (1:1 pixel ratio)
   - **Focus Annotation**: Intelligently zoom to optimal viewing level for the selected annotation
   - **Spacebar Panning**: Hold spacebar + drag for temporary panning in any mode (works like Photoshop)
   - **Smart Resize**: Canvas automatically resizes to use full available space on zoom operations

6. **Export Data**: Click "Export" in the toolbar to download a JSON file with all annotation data

7. **Import Data**: Use "Import" to load previously saved annotation sessions

### Interface Layout

- **Horizontal Toolbar**: All annotation and navigation tools in a single row for easy access
  - **Drawing Modes**: Draw and Select (2 streamlined modes with integrated functionality)
  - **Zoom Controls**: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Fit to Screen, Actual Size, and Focus Annotation with percentage display
  - **Data Management**: Export/import functions for annotation data
- **Compact Sidebar**: Image upload and management (12.5% width) with support for images and PDF files
  - **Independent Scrolling**: Image list scrolls separately with fixed height container
  - **PDF Conversion**: Visual feedback during PDF-to-image conversion process
- **Dynamic Canvas Area**: Main annotation workspace (87.5% width) with maximum space utilization
  - **Full Space Usage**: Canvas automatically uses all available width and height
  - **Smart Resizing**: Automatic resize triggers on image selection and zoom operations
  - **Real-time Resize**: Canvas adjusts on window resize with optimal performance
- **Full Viewport**: Utilizes entire browser width for maximum workspace efficiency

### Data Format

Exported JSON follows this structure:

```json
[
  {
    "filename": "image1.jpg",
    "annotations": [
      {
        "id": "unique-id",
        "x": 150,
        "y": 200,
        "radius": 25,
        "label": "Object 1"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
