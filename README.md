## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cskevint/annotator.git
cd annotator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload Images**: Drag and drop images or PDF files, or use the file picker to upload web-compatible images (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP) and PDF documents

2. **Auto-Selection**: The first uploaded image is automatically selected when no images are loaded, ready for immediate annotation

3. **Create Annotations**: 
   - Click and drag anywhere on the image to create circular annotations
   - The radius expands as you move away from the initial click point  
   - **Newly created annotations are automatically selected** for immediate editing

4. **Manage Annotations**:
   - **Contextual Operation**: The interface intelligently switches between drawing and selecting based on your actions:
     - **Click and drag outside annotations**: Creates new annotations (drawing context)
     - **Click on existing annotations**: Selects them for editing (selection context)
   - **Selected Annotation Actions**:
     - **Delete**: Click the red X button in the top-right corner of the selected annotation
     - **Move**: Click and drag anywhere inside the selected annotation to move it
     - **Resize**: Click and drag the red resize handle (circle on the right edge) to adjust size
     - **Edit Label**: Double-click anywhere inside the annotation to open the label editing dialog with smart positioning

5. **Navigate & Zoom**:
   - **Auto-Fit**: Images automatically fit to screen when first selected for optimal viewing
   - **Zoom In/Out**: Use zoom controls to get closer or farther from the image
   - **Fit to Screen**: Automatically fit the entire image in the viewport
   - **Actual Size**: View image at 100% (1:1 pixel ratio)
   - **Focus Annotation**: Intelligently zoom and position to show the entire selected annotation with comfortable padding
   - **Spacebar Panning**: Hold spacebar + drag for temporary panning in any mode (works like Photoshop)
   - **Smart Resize**: Canvas automatically resizes to use full available space on zoom operations

6. **Export Data**: Click "Export" in the toolbar to download a JSON file with all annotation data

7. **Import Data**: Use "Import" to load previously saved annotation sessions

### Interface Layout

- **Fixed Viewport Sidebar**: Data management and image upload in single column with no application scrollbars
  - **Data Management**: Import/export buttons and total annotation count at top (always visible)
  - **Image Upload**: Upload area with drag-and-drop functionality (always visible)  
  - **Independent Scrolling**: Image list scrolls separately with explicit height constraints and overflow handling
  - **Resizable Width**: Drag invisible divider to adjust sidebar width (280px - 600px) with escape key support and real-time canvas adaptation
  - **PDF Conversion**: Visual feedback during PDF-to-image conversion process
- **Dynamic Canvas Area**: Main annotation workspace (87.5% width) with maximum space utilization
  - **Floating Zoom Controls**: Top-right corner overlay with all zoom functions and percentage display
  - **Contextual Interaction**: Click outside annotations to draw, click on annotations to select (seamless contextual workflow)
  - **Full Space Usage**: Canvas automatically uses all available width and height with `h-full flex flex-col min-h-0` constraints
  - **Smart Resizing**: Automatic resize triggers on image selection and zoom operations with debounced resize events and real-time sidebar adaptation
  - **Real-time Resize**: Canvas adjusts on window resize with optimal performance using `ResizeObserver` and key-based re-rendering for sidebar changes
- **Fixed Viewport Design**: Uses full browser viewport height (`h-screen overflow-hidden`) for maximum workspace efficiency

### Data Format

Exported JSON follows this structure:

```json
[
  {
    "filename": "image1.jpg",
    "annotations": [
      {
        "id": "unique-id",
        "x": 150,
        "y": 200,
        "radius": 25,
        "label": "Object 1"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
