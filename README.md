## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cskevint/annotator.git
cd annotator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload Images**: Drag and drop images or PDF files, or use the file picker to upload web-compatible images (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP) and PDF documents

2. **Select Image**: Click on an uploaded image to begin annotation (PDF pages are automatically converted to PNG images with descriptive filenames)

3. **Create Annotations**: 
   - Select "Draw" mode in the toolbar
   - Click and drag on the image to create circular annotations
   - The radius expands as you move away from the initial click point

4. **Manage Annotations**:
   - **Select**: Use "Select" mode to choose annotations
   - **Move**: Use "Move" mode to drag annotations to new positions
   - **Resize**: Use "Resize" mode to adjust annotation size by dragging the edge
   - **Pan**: Use "Pan" mode to navigate around the image (or hold spacebar + drag for temporary panning)
   - **Delete**: Select an annotation and click the delete button in the toolbar
   - **Label**: Add descriptive labels to annotations using the label input

5. **Navigate & Zoom**:
   - **Auto-Fit**: Images automatically fit to screen when first selected for optimal viewing
   - **Zoom In/Out**: Use zoom controls to get closer or farther from the image
   - **Fit to Screen**: Automatically fit the entire image in the viewport
   - **Actual Size**: View image at 100% (1:1 pixel ratio)
   - **Spacebar Panning**: Hold spacebar + drag for temporary panning in any mode (works like Photoshop)
   - **Smart Resize**: Canvas automatically resizes to use full available space on zoom operations

6. **Export Data**: Click "Export" in the toolbar to download a JSON file with all annotation data

7. **Import Data**: Use "Import" to load previously saved annotation sessions

### Interface Layout

- **Horizontal Toolbar**: All annotation and navigation tools in a single row for easy access
  - **Drawing Modes**: Draw, Select, Move, Resize, Pan (5 total modes)
  - **Zoom Controls**: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Fit to Screen, Actual Size with percentage display
  - **Annotation Management**: Label editing, delete, export/import functions
- **Compact Sidebar**: Image upload and management (12.5% width) with support for images and PDF files
  - **Independent Scrolling**: Image list scrolls separately with fixed height container
  - **PDF Conversion**: Visual feedback during PDF-to-image conversion process
- **Dynamic Canvas Area**: Main annotation workspace (87.5% width) with maximum space utilization
  - **Full Space Usage**: Canvas automatically uses all available width and height
  - **Smart Resizing**: Automatic resize triggers on image selection and zoom operations
  - **Real-time Resize**: Canvas adjusts on window resize with optimal performance
- **Full Viewport**: Utilizes entire browser width for maximum workspace efficiency

### Data Format

Exported JSON follows this structure:

```json
[
  {
    "filename": "image1.jpg",
    "annotations": [
      {
        "id": "unique-id",
        "x": 150,
        "y": 200,
        "radius": 25,
        "label": "Object 1"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
